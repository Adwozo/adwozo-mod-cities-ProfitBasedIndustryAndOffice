This mod introduces different AI system for industrial and office buildings in the game. Key features include:

- Companies make expansion and contraction decisions based on their profit-to-worth ratio rather than product storage amount.
- Considers material costs.
- Includes safeguards for very small companies.

This mod aims to create a more dynamic and realistic economic simulation within the game and solve the current issue with the economy update.
Please give some time for the mod to take effect.

	<LongDescription>
    <p>
      <strong>This mod introduces different AI system for industrial and office buildings in the game. Key features include:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Companies make expansion and contraction decisions based on their profit-to-worth ratio rather than product storage amount.</li>
      <li>Considers material costs.</li>
      <li>Includes safeguards for very small companies.</li>
      <li>Set minimum company headcount to 1/4 of building capacity</li>
      <li>Added system to sell company product to outside city (graph still dont update as of now)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Logic</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>The original in game calculation is as follow</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>less than 1/4 amount of storage fill with product, increase headcount</li>
      <li>more than 1/2 amount of storage fill will product, decrease headcount</li>
      <li>minimum company headcount is 5</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Issue</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Office do not sell any of the product</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>This mod modify the calculation logic</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The profit-to-worth ratio (ptw) is equal to</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>for industry (cash reserves - material cost)/company total worth</li>
      <li>for office cash reserves/company total worth</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>The mod logic</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>if the ptw is larger than the Threshold it will increase headcount and vise versa</li>
      <li>if the company total worth is smaller than the small company threshold headcount will stay at full</li>
      <li>minimum company headcount to 1/4 of building capacity</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <strong>Effect of the mod</strong>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>you will see company headcount go to a slightly lower level than pre economy update</li>
      <li>traffic will increase</li>
      <li>non profiting company could see decrease headcount</li>
      <li>tax rate could impact company headcount more dramatically (by logic not verify)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <strong>Future plan</strong>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>investigate the threshold further to generate a balance</li>
      <li>create a option for user to define the threshold using percentile</li>
      <li>small company and threshold would be better as a curve so set as a equation</li>
    </ul>
